## Initial Project Setup

### SSR Tutorials

#### [react router ssr](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-server-rendering/)

This was modified to use the latest versions babel and webpack. I also had to update the babel section of the `package.json` file.

#### [react code splitting ssr](https://medium.com/bucharestjs/upgrading-a-create-react-app-project-to-a-ssr-code-splitting-setup-9da57df2040a)

I used the response logic from this to make it easier to serve up an html file from public directory.


#### [material-ui ssr](https://material-ui.com/guides/server-rendering/)
